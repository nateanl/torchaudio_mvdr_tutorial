This repository maintains the tutorial on how to apply MVDR beamforming by using torchaudio
-----------

The multi-channel audio example is selected from [ConferencingSpeech](https://github.com/ConferencingSpeech/ConferencingSpeech2021) dataset.

Note: you need to clone the latest [torchaudio](https://github.com/pytorch/audio) repo in order to use the MVDR module under audio/examples/beamforming/mvdr.py

- Ideal Ratio Mask (IRM) is generated by dividing the clean/noise magnitude by the mixture magnitude.
- We test all three solutions (``ref_channel``, ``stv_evd``, ``stv_power``) of torchaudio's MVDR module.
- We test the single-channel and multi-channel masks for MVDR beamforming. The multi-channel mask is averaged along channel dimension when computing the covariance matrices of speech and noise, respectively.
